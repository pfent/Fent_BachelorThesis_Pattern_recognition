All in all: In this paper, we identified users based solely on acceleration data. Proof of concept, 

\section{Current state}

Many tunable parameters with a relatively small test size -> results not universally applicable. 80\% with a rather simple approach is really good!

However, performance is in a realistic range for practical use. Input of a password takes several seconds, during which we can train our kNN classifier with >100 previous measurements.

In real applications, this training probably only needs to take place ONCE. A single measurement does not take a full second, even on the Sony Smartwatch 3.

Smartrings with even lower powered processors are probably too slow for processing on the ring, but good chances with future development in low power processor speeds.

\section{Future prospects}

Maybe interpolation of measurements for real word usage? Overall the feature extraction is in a good shape.

Distances between keystrokes on the watch also needs work, currently only a concept.

Biggest improvement: neuronal networks to classify and detect promise better detection rates. Also faster to classify data, but potentially need longer computation time for learning.

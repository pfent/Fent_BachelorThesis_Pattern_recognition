Special thanks go to Prof. Dr. Senjun Song and Nils Kannengie√üer, who gave me the opportunity to work on an international project. Nils especially guided be and taught me many things used in this thesis, esp.\ during the Android Practical Course in summer 2015.

Many thanks also go to the Chair of Operating Systems at \gls{tum} for hosting this thesis and Prof. Dr. Uwe Baumgarten as a supervisor. The Chair of Operating Systems provided test devices, crucial for the concept of this thesis.

I also like to thank several students from the Andoid practical course 2015/16 for generation of test data and H.\ Wang, T.\ Lai and R.\ Choudhury for their paper on Motion Leaks\cite{wang2015mole}, which initially sparked the ideas outlined in this thesis. Also thanks to many unnamed proofreaders and reviewers and everyone that supported me during writing.
